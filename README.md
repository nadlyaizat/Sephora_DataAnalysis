This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Sephora products and skincare reviews. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle.com and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews).

## Analysis

The project consists of four main analyses, each exploring different aspects of the Sephora dataset:

### 1. Sentiment of Customer Reviews

- **Aim**: Explore the sentiment of customer reviews and its correlation with recommended products.
- **Hypothesis**: Customer reviews with positive sentiment (positive ratings and recommended products) are more likely to be associated with higher loves_count for skincare products.

### 2. Impact of Skin Tone and Skin Type on Product Ratings and Recommendations

- **Aim**: Investigate the impact of skin tone and skin type on product ratings and recommendations.
- **Hypothesis**: Customer reviews with positive sentiment (positive ratings and recommended products) are more likely to be associated with higher loves_count for skincare products.

### 3. Most Popular Brands

- **Aim**: Identify the most popular skincare brands on Sephora's online store.
- **Hypothesis**: The skincare brands with the highest number of product reviews and loves_count are the most popular among customers.

### 4. Price vs Ratings

- **Aim**: Investigate the relationship between product ratings and price for skincare products.
- **Hypothesis**: Skincare products with higher prices tend to have higher average ratings compared to lower-priced products.
